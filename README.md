# HBnB Project: Technical Documentation

## Introduction

This technical document outlines the architectural and design structure of the **HBnB** project. It compiles all the design artifacts package diagram, class diagram, and sequence diagrams into one cohesive reference. The document provides a comprehensive overview of the system's layered architecture, core components, and interactions to guide implementation and maintenance.

## High-Level Architecture
 
### Diagram: High-Level Package Diagram

### Description

The high-level architecture follows a multi-layered design that separates concerns for better modularity and maintainability.

- **Presentation Layer (API):**  
  Handles incoming HTTP requests, validates input, and delegates tasks to the Business Logic Layer.

- **Business Logic Layer:**  
  Contains the core application logic and domain models. Acts as a mediator between the API and Persistence layers.

- **Persistence Layer (Database):**  
  Manages direct access to the data sources. Encapsulates all the logic for saving and retrieving data.

### Design Pattern Used: Facade Pattern

The **Facade** in the Business Logic Layer simplifies interactions between the API and the underlying subsystems (e.g., repositories).

## Business Logic Layer

### Diagram: Detailed Class Diagram

> *(Insert Diagram Image Here)*  
> Example:  
> `![Class Diagram](./documentation/class_diagram.png)`

### Description

This diagram provides a deep dive into the core components and relationships within the Business Logic Layer.

#### Key Classes

- `User`: Represents a user entity with properties like `id`, `email`, `password`.
- `UserService`: Provides business operations such as registration, validation, and retrieval of users.
- `Repositories`: Interface for data access (e.g., `UserRepository`) to abstract database interactions.

#### Relationships

- `UserService` depends on `UserRepository` for persistence operations.
- `User` is a model used across various services and layers.

#### Design Decisions

- Services are **stateless** and **testable**.
- Repositories are injected as dependencies for **loose coupling**.

## API Interaction Flow

### Diagram: Sequence Diagram for User Registration

> *(Insert Diagram Image Here)*  
> Example:  
> `![Sequence Diagram](./documentation/sequence_diagram.png)`

### Steps


User ->> API: registration(username, email, password)
API ->> BusinessLogic: validateUser()
BusinessLogic ->> BusinessLogic: validated
BusinessLogic ->> BusinessLogic: createUser()
BusinessLogic ->> Repository: saveUser()
Repository -->> BusinessLogic: success
BusinessLogic -->> API: User Created
API -->> User: 201 Created


###  Description

This interaction illustrates the flow of a **registration API call** from the front-end to database insertion.

- `201 Created`: HTTP status code indicating successful resource creation.
- Emphasis is on validation and separation of responsibilities across layers.

###  Design Rationale

- The sequence ensures **modular validation**, **safe persistence**, and **clear response communication**.
- Aligns with **RESTful API design principles**.

##  Conclusion

This document serves as the **blueprint for implementing the HBnB project**. It ensures consistency in architectural decisions and provides a clear reference for team members. All diagrams and descriptions are aligned with **best practices** in software architecture and **object-oriented design**.
